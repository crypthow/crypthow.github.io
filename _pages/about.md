**CryptHow** is a blog where I share my experience with cryptocurrencies and the crypto community.

I've invested into crypto, but quickly found myself lost and overwhelmed with all the information and claims made in the community.

I am in no way a financial advisor, just a crypto holder who is trying to make sense of all the noise surrounding the topic of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Take what I say with a pinch of salt and do your own research.
